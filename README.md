# Introduction
## Problem Statement
A study of University of Lapland revealed that out of 2,33,000 bookings, the overall cancellation rate is 8%.
With a such cancellation rate, we can determine that this is a detrimental situation for both the hotel management and significantly affects the customer experience
For the Hotel:
If a visitor cancels their reservation just before check-in, the hotel may not be able to rebook the room and lose some of the money they would have made.
Customer Experience:
Overbooking tactics, brought about by unpredictable cancellations, may harm the customer experience. Accurate projections are essential to balance reservations and provide visitors with the high-quality experience they demand.

## Our Approach
So in order to make such a prediction system we would need to create a Classification Model with decent accuracy.
A website is to be created, which would use the model registered in the cloud with the help of API endpoints, and show the predicted results to the user.

# Data Collection
Our dataset contains 1,19,390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, our hotel booking cancellation prediction system, have been able to predict results with an accuracy of approximately 77%.
We have seen that ensemble learning techniques have given superior results compared to other standard models.
Applying Hypertuning techniques to the model have significantly improved the results.
The statistically derived features had given better results, compared to standard feature Engineering Techniques.
